# 1.	Motivation:
500$ parking ticket issued...!! ðŸ¥µ. If youâ€™ve ever driven a car in New York City, you probably know the drill: The cityâ€™s free on-street parking gives a small, temporary benefit to a few lucky drivers. People tend to violate the parking rules creating big problems for everyone else. This unique dataset enlightens the causes and most frequent areas of parking breaches. If we care about cities and urban mobility, we really need to pay some attention to parking. If people are not parking correctly like taking place of two parking places for just one car, park in the handicapped reserved place. Without rationing, parking fills up due to illegal parking, double parking leading to traffic caused by parking search. Hence, parking has to be managed strictly by enforcing laws to prevent such problems. The outcome of the project will help the government plan for proper investment of resources and improve focus on regions where rate of parking violations is more and also concentrate on frequently occurring categories of violations. Also, we can ensure the Parking policy success from the analyzing the dataset further.
1)Where the rate of traffic rule violation is more i.e. more need of strict actions need to be taken by the traffic police?
	2)Which place is ideal in case of parking violations and no need of much attention as people are likely to follow all the rules? 
3)What is the rate of rule violations of the society and is the vehicle expired?
If you read further, you can get to know about the interesting things that can be analyzed from the dataset like what kind of parking violations would cost you more or less? Also, you can identify the regions where you should be more careful while violating the rules even for a couple of minutes. 
Apart from just these things we can further analyze to get the answers to following questions
